# Chapter 07: Memory allocation

## Question 7-1
------------

**Question:**

Modify the program in Listing 7-1 ( free_and_sbrk.c ) to print out the current value of the program break after each execution of malloc(). Run the program specifying a small allocation block size. This will demonstrate that malloc() doesnâ€™t employ sbrk() to adjust the program break on each call, but instead periodically allocates larger chunks of memory from which it passes back small pieces to the caller.

**Answer:**

See `free-and-sbrk.c`

## Question 7-2
------------

**Question:**

(Advanced) Implement malloc() and free().

**Answer:**

See `malloc.c`
