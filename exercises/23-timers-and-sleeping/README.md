# Chapter 23 - Timers and Sleeping

## Question 23-1

---

**Question:**

Although alarm() is implemented as a system call within the Linux kernel, this is
redundant. Implement alarm() using setitimer().

**Answer:**

See `alarm.c`.

## Question 23-2

**Question:**

Try running the program in Listing 23-3 (t_nanosleep.c) in the background with a
60-second sleep interval, while using the following command to send as many
SIGINT signals as possible to the background process:

```
$ while true; do kill -INT pid; done
```

You should observe that the program sleeps rather longer than expected. Replace
the use of nanosleep() with the use of clock_gettime() (use a CLOCK_REALTIME clock) and
clock_nanosleep() with the TIMER_ABSTIME flag. (This exercise requires Linux 2.6.)
Repeat the test with the modified program and explain the difference.

**Answer:**

The behavior explained above explains why we have a sleeping time bigger than expected.
When the nanosleep call is interrupted by a signal and we reeschedule it with the remaining
sleep time it may be rounded up so we get extra sleep. With a high frequency signal this
rounding may happend very frequently and we end up with a lot of extra sleep.

Using TIMER_ABSTIME eliminates this repetitive rounding and we get the correct sleep time.

From the text bookÃ‡

See `clock_nanosleep.c`.

## Question 23-3

---

**Question:**

Write a program to show that if the evp argument to timer_create() is specified as
NULL, then this is equivalent to specifying evp as a pointer to a sigevent structure with
sigev_notify set to SIGEV_SIGNAL, sigev_signo set to SIGALRM, and si_value.sival_int set to
the timer ID.

**Answer:**

See `timer-create.c`.

## Question 23-4

---

**Question:**

Modify the program in Listing 23-5 (ptmr_sigev_signal.c) to use sigwaitinfo() instead
of a signal handler.

**Answer:**

See `ptmr_sigev_signal.c`.
